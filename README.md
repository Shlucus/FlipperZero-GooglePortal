## Features:

- Responsive Web Design (Mobile & Desktop).
- Cursor hover and transition animations.
- Working language dropdown menu.
- Resembles Google's modern UI.

## Instructions:

If you have [bigbrodude6119](https://github.com/bigbrodude6119)'s first released firmware flashed onto your WifiDevBoard (evil-portal-0.0.1), you will need to flash it AGAIN with the release `evil-portal-0.0.2` <ins>or newer</ins> for this portal to work. It has an improved size limit for the HTML files (20k characters up from 4k) which I utilized to create a more advanced/realisic Google portal than the default portal that comes with it.

Click [here](https://github.com/bigbrodude6119/flipper-zero-evil-portal/releases/tag/0.0.2) to do that.
