## Overview:
This is an <ins>improved</ins> Google portal I've created for [bigbrodude6119](https://github.com/bigbrodude6119)'s EvilPortal app for the Flipper-Zero.

This repo contains a single HTML file(JS & CSS incl.) to be used in combination of a Flipper Zero + WifiDevBoard(ESP32-S2) to conduct a captive portal / phishing attack. This allows this page to be publicly broadcasted via an access point hosted by the WifiDevBoard. Upon access, whatever credentials are inputted by a user will be sent directly to the Flipper-Zero.

## Features:

- Responsive Web Design (Mobile & Desktop).
- Cursor hover and transition animations.
- Working language dropdown menu.
- Resembles Google's modern UI.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have [bigbrodude6119](https://github.com/bigbrodude6119)'s first released firmware flashed onto your WifiDevBoard (evil-portal-0.0.1), you will need to flash it AGAIN with the release `evil-portal-0.0.2` 
 <ins>or newer</ins> for this portal to work. It has an improved size limit for the HTML files (20k characters up from 4k) which I utilized to create a more advanced/realisic Google portal than the default portal 
 that comes with it.
